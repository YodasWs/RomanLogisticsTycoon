<h2>Devlog #10: Back From the Holidays and Back to Work</h2>
<p>It’s been a little while since the last update. I ended up spending most of the past month with family and the holidays, which was wonderful but also meant stepping away from the project longer than expected. Now that things have settled down, I’m easing back into development and wanted to share where things stand.</p>
<p>I also received two pull requests during the break — always exciting to see interest and contributions coming in. They’re both ambitious and touch a lot of the codebase, so I’m still evaluating how (or whether) they fit into the project’s direction. Even if they don’t end up merging, it’s energizing to see people engaging with the work.</p>
<h3>🔧 Tooling Work — SCSS Linter Upgrade</h3>
<p>One of the first tasks I tackled after returning was upgrading the SCSS linter. I wasn’t sure whether this would be interesting enough to mention, but it ended up being a surprisingly big speed bump. The upgrade itself was straightforward, but getting it to actually run required tracking down a tiny, almost comically small dependency issue. Once that was fixed, everything snapped back into place. Not glamorous work, but it feels good to have the tooling modernized and stable again.</p>
<h3>🍎 Gameplay Progress — Food Destacking and Spoilage Indicator</h3>
<p>On the gameplay side, today was much more satisfying. I finally de‑stacked the Food goods on the hexagons so they no longer pile visually on top of each other. That alone makes the board feel cleaner and easier to read. I also started implementing the spoilage countdown: each Food good now displays a simple hourglass that shifts from green to yellow to red as it approaches expiration. It’s a small touch, but it adds clarity and personality to the system, and it’s already making the grid feel more alive.</p>
<p>More to come soon — it feels good to be back in the flow.</p>
